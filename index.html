    <h2>Architecture</h2>
    <h3>The art or practice of designing and constructing buildings.</h3>
        <p>
            <em>Architecture</em> has a relation with space and everything
            around built structures.  Having spent time thinking on how this
            works in different situations, has helped me understand the
            relationship with space and built structure. Also reading books
            and being dedicated to the study of architecture has taught me a
            few things.  Space is important in this growing world, as we lack
            space, in modern urban center's around theworld.  Space and
            proportion are very important in creating a enviroments.<p>
