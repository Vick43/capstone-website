    <h2>Architecture</h2>
    <h3>The art or practice of designing and constructing buildings.</h3>
        <p>
            <em>Architecture</em> has a relation with space and everything
            around built structures.  Having spent time thinking on how this
            works in different situations, has helped me understand the
            relationship with space and built structure. Also reading books
            and being dedicated to the study of architecture has taught me a
            few things.  Space is important in this growing world, as we lack
            space in modern urban center's around the world, we find theres less
            space for our living and working enviroments.  Space, and
            proportion are very important in creating these enviroments.  Space
            helps us feel safe or gives us a place to think and rest, and proportionhelps us put thing in proper place and helps keep things organized.

            This site was designed to help you understand how this works.  Take in the use of space as you scroll down.  Keep in mind this site is
            a visual for some thing that keeps me working at learning <em>arc
            hitecture</em> for a proffession.  Notice the space as you scroll
            down and compare left to right.  This will give you an idea of how
            build structure fits with space, both positive and negative.
